# Ansible Role: Packer Debian/Ubuntu Configuration for Vagrant VirtualBox

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/geerlingguy/ansible-role-packer-debian.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/geerlingguy/ansible-role-packer-debian)

This role configures Debian/Ubuntu (either minimal or full install) in preparation for it to be packaged as part of a .box file for Vagrant/VirtualBox or Vagrant/Vmware_desktop deployment using [Packer](http://www.packer.io/).

## Requirements

Prior to running this role via Packer, you need to make sure Ansible is installed via a shell provisioner, and that preliminary VM configuration (like adding a vagrant user to the appropriate group and the sudoers file) is complete, generally by using a Kickstart installation file (e.g. `ks.cfg`) or [preseeding method](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/installation-guide/s390x/apbs02.html) with Packer. An example array of provisioners for your Packer .json template would be something like:

```json

    "provisioners": [
      {
        "type": "shell",
        "execute_command": "echo 'vagrant' | {{.Vars}} sudo -S -E bash '{{.Path}}'",
        "script": "scripts/ansible.sh"
      },
      {
        "type": "ansible-local",
        "playbook_file": "ansible/main.yml",
        "role_paths": [
          "/Users/jgeerling/Dropbox/VMs/roles/geerlingguy.packer-debian",
        ]
      }
    ],

```

The files should contain, at a minimum:

**scripts/ansible.sh**:

An example for Ubuntu 16.04

```bash
#!/bin/bash -eux
# Install Ansible repository and Ansible.
apt -y install software-properties-common
apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
apt-get update
apt-get install ansible
```

An example for Debian 8.8

```bash
#!/bin/bash -eux

# Install Ansible repository and Ansible
apt -y install software-properties-common
echo "deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/ansible/ansible/ubuntu trusty main" | tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 93C4A3FD7BB9C367
apt -y update
apt -y install ansible
```


**ansible/main.yml**:

```
---
- hosts: all
  sudo: yes
  gather_facts: yes
  roles:
    - geerlingguy.packer-debian
```


You might also want to add another shell provisioner to run cleanup, erasing free space using `dd`, but this is not required (it will just save a little disk space in the Packer-produced .box file).

If you'd like to add additional roles, make sure you add them to the `role_paths` array in the template .json file, and then you can include them in `main.yml` as you normally would. The Ansible configuration will be run over a local connection from within the Linux environment, so all relevant files need to be copied over to the VM; configuratin for this is in the template .json file. Read more: [Ansible Local Provisioner](http://www.packer.io/docs/provisioners/ansible-local.html).

## Role Variables

Available variables are listed below, along with default values (see defaults/main.yml):

```
vmware_install_open_vm_tools: "false"
```

Using the vmware_install_open_vm_tools variable you can select what kind of integration components will be installed into the VMware box. Default value of vmware_install_open_vm_tools is "false" what means that VMware Tools (not open-vm-tools) will be installed.
